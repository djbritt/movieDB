# Movie Database :movie_camera:
## By Daniel Britt

For a web engineering class, in one month as the lead developer, with one other student, I created an entire movie database. You can register an account, add movies, delete movies, generate movie info reports, edit a movie, all using AJAX to access a SQL database.

This project uses HTML5, CSS3, PHP, Javascript, and jQuery.
